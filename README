NAME
       xwinpp - prepare a list of X windows

SYNOPSIS
       xwinpp (-|-F|-h|-v) [-s] [-P] (-p|-r|-t)

REQUIREMENT
       GNU bash, GNU sed, xprop, xwininfo

DESCRIPTION
       xwinpp is a bash shell script that takes a list of X window ids
       and performs some actions on it. Mainly, xwinpp is written to
       process a preparing output with variables on that list. A typical
       output looks like this:

       desk_curr=0
       desk_select=( 0 )
       win_active=0x2c00022
       win_active_geo_x_y=( 0,1 )
       win_active_geo_w_h=( 1680,1049 )
       win_active_frame_extents=0,0,0,0
       win_active_tags=
       win_xid=( 0x00e00002 0x024000a3 0x014b5c9f 0x02c00022 )
       win_number=4
       win_geo_x_y=( 0,1 0,1 0,1 0,1 )
       win_geo_w_h=( 1680,1049 1680,1049 1680,1049 1680,1049 )
       win_frame_extents=( 0,0,0,0 0,0,0,0 0,0,0,0 0,0,0,0 )
       win_tags=( )

OPTIONS
       -
              Get X window ids by reading from standard input; - must
              be the first argument.

       -F, -file FILE
              Obtain X window ids from FILE, not from standard input.

       -P, -active-win-pos POS
              By default, xwinpp processes X window ids in order of input.
              To specify the position of active window in the output
              use this option together with -p.

       -aw, -active-win XID
              By default, xwinpp uses _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW to find the
              active window out. To specify another window you can use
              this option.

       -s, -select
              Tell xwinpp to select and filter the input. You need to
              specify the selection by using at least one of: -D, -S,
              -b, -B

       -D, -desk DESK...
              Select windows, which are on DESK. By default, windows on
              current desktop are used.

       -S, -tags TAG...
              Select windows, which are tagged with TAG.

       -b, -visible
              Select windows, which are visible. A window is visible,
              if _NET_WM_STATE_HIDDEN is not set.

       -B, -hidden
              Select windows, which are hidden. A window is hidden,
              if _NET_WM_STATE_HIDDEN is set.

       -h, -help
              Display a short help.

       -v, -version
              Print current version of xwinpp.

SUBCOMMANDS
       -p, -print
              Print a preparing output with variables. You can specify
              the output with -s and -P.

       -t, -tag ( set TAGSTRING | unset )
              Tag or untag windows from input. You can specify widows
              with -s.

       -r, -remove PROPERTY_NAME
              Remove PROPERTY_NAME of windows from input. You can specify
              windows with -s.

ARGUMENTS
       FILE
              File may be a regular file or a named pipe.

       DESK
              Desktop number specified by an integer or curr. To declare
              more than one desktop, separate it with a space character.
              Example: "0 1 2"; curr is not allowed then.

       POS
              Position of the active window in the output specified by an
              integer. You may also write start or end. Position starts
              with 1.

       PROPERTY_NAME
              Name of window and font property in an X server.

       TAGSTRING
              You have to set all strings in _XWINPP_TAGS property at
              the same time. To set a string with more than one tag,
              seperate it with a colon. Example: gui:viewer:pdf.

       TAG
              Tag, which was specified as _XWINPP_TAGS property in an
              X server. To select more than one tag, seperate it with
              a colon. Example: gui:pdf.

       XID    Numeric window identity.

EXAMPLES
       To print a preparing output:
              wmctrl -l | xwinpp - -p
              wmctrl -lx | grep xterm | xwinpp - -p
              xwinpp - -p < <(wmctrl -l)
              xwinpp -F /tmp/xids -p
              xwinpp -F <(wmctrl -l) -p
              wmctrl -l | WIN_ACTIVE=0x3000022 xwinpp - -p
              wmctrl -l | xwinpp - -aw 0x3000022 -p

       To print a preparing output, but filter before:
              wmctrl -l | xwinpp - -s -b -p
              wmctrl -l | xwinpp - -s -D 1 -p
              wmctrl -l | xwinpp - -s -b -D "0 1" -p
              wmctrl -l | xwinpp - -s -B -D "1 0" -p
              wmctrl -l | xwinpp - -s -S gui:pdf -p

       To print a preparing output and reorder active win:
              wmctrl -l | xwinpp - -P end -p
              wmctrl -l | xwinpp - -P 1 -p

       To tag or untag windows with _XWINPP_TAGS property:
              wmctrl -l | xwinpp - -t set office:audio:video
              wmctrl -l | xwinpp - -s -D 0 -t set gui:viewer:pdf
              wmctrl -l | xwinpp - -s -B -t unset

       To remove window or font property:
              wmctrl -l | xwinpp - -r WM_NORMAL_HINTS

RETURN VALUES
       1
              USAGE: xwinpp (-|-F|-h|-v) [-s] [-P] (-p|-r|-t)

       2
              What is biting your current desktop?

       3
              Wrongly, only_visible and only_hidden are set to true. Do
              not use -b and -B at the same time.

NOTES
       ·   You can write all commands and options without masking -. So,
           instead of -help you may use help.

       ·   You  do  not have to use wmctrl for fetching X window ids.
           You can also use xdotool, xlsclients, xwit, xwininfo or xprop.
           But ensure to get an input, which is separated by newline;
           window ids must be in the first field and separated from
           second field with space character (delimiter=space). See
           also: <https://gist.github.com/D630/11346608> and
           <http://www.ict.griffith.edu.au/anthony/info/X/WindowID.hints>

       · _NET_WM_STATE_HIDDEN means, that a window is iconified/minimized.

ENVIROMENT
       WIN_ACTIVE
              You may use this variable instead option -aw.
